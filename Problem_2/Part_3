To support any data type in the tree instead of just integers, we would make the following changes:

Generics:
Using Java Generics to define the node's data type, allowing for more flexibility.

Serialization and Deserialization:
To handle generic types during serialization and deserialization, the methods should be able to convert the data type to a string during serialization and convert it back from a string during deserialization. This means there must be some standardized way to represent each possible data type as a string, and also to convert it back. One common solution is to use JSON representation.

However, this also means that not all data types can be directly supported unless we have a defined mechanism to serialize and deserialize them. Java's basic built-in types can be handled relatively easily, but user-defined types or complex data structures will require custom serialization methods or a serialization library.

Step By Step Approach :

Generify Node Class

public class Node<T> 
{
    Node<T> left;
    Node<T> right;
    T data;
}

 Update Serializer Interface

 public interface TreeSerializer<T> 
 {
    String serialize(Node<T> root);
    Node<T> deserialize(String str);
}

When serializing T data in the Node, we can convert basic Java types (like String, Integer, Double, etc.) to string using String.valueOf(data). When deserializing, we would need a way to determine the type and convert the string back to that type.
